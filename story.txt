I come back home, tired, really tired, just finishing two midterms. It's already 1:00 AM, but my roommate is not at home. I connect my laptop to the Thunderbolt Dock, as usually, to see if there is any other homework available. However, all the homework disappeared from Canvas timeline, and I find out that I am not currently enrolled in any class.

I was panicked, I opened outlook to check if there are any notifications from the university. But the school email 
account was disabled and I got logged out from outlook. I started panicking more. I opened myUW page. Thankfully, I still 
have access to myUW. But when I opened my profile page, one window popped up.

"We see you" the window read in big red letters. I sat stunned in silence, before quickly looking around my room thinking maybe it was one of my room mate's pranks,
but no one was there. My thoughts started racing, trying to figure out what was going on, but when I turned back to my laptop screen the window had dissapeared. I 
check canvas again and all my homework has returned but I can't help but feel frightened. I go to sleep wondering if I imagined the whole event.
