I come back home, tired, really tired, just finishing two midterms. It's already 1:00 AM, but my roommate is not at home. I connect my laptop to the Thunderbolt Dock, as usually, to see if there is any other homework available. However, all the homework disappeared from Canvas timeline, and I find out that I am not currently enrolled in any class.
