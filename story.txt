I come back home, tired, really tired, just finishing two midterms. It's already 1:00 AM, but my roommate is not at home. I connect my laptop to the Thunderbolt Dock, as usually, to see if there is any other homework available. However, all the homework disappeared from Canvas timeline, and I find out that I am not currently enrolled in any class.

I was panicked, I opened outlook to check if there are any notifications from the university. But the school email 
account was disabled and I got logged out from outlook. I started panicking more. I opened myUW page. Thankfully, I still 
have access to myUW. But when I opened my profile page, one window popped up.
